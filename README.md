# **Student Dropout Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project aims to predict student dropout rates using machine learning techniques based on various datasets containing academic, financial, and demographic factors. By leveraging predictive analytics, this project seeks to provide insights that can assist educational institutions in identifying at-risk students and improving retention rates.

## **Project Features**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalized all numerical features to bring them to a consistent scale.
   - Encoded the target variable (`Dropout`, `Enrolled`, `Graduate`) for machine learning compatibility.
   - Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identified key predictors such as financial status, marital status, and academic performance.
   - Ranked features based on their importance using correlation and feature importance metrics.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Used hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Ensured fair representation of demographic groups in the dataset.
   - Applied techniques like re-weighting and fairness constraints to reduce bias in predictions.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to analyze trends and relationships between key features and dropout rates.
   - Generated comparative plots for model performance evaluation.
